1. Data-preprocessing
  - Imputation must be executed after splitting train and test dataset. Or the trained model would end up with overfitting because it already learned about test datasets during training.
  
2. What if weights and bias are all zero? Will a model learn with the pre-weights and bias of 0?
  - Yes, it will becasue gradient descent is $\frac{\partial C}{\partial}$

1. What is the difference between A.I, machine learning, and deep learning?
  - Depth and activation functions (making the learning process non-linear)

2. What is the difference between percentron and neuron?

3. Why actionvation functions must have non-linear property?
